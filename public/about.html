      <p>
        How did we all become the scared white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland? 80% of our generation 
        has climate anxiety. We're scared and worried about the planet and its future. "We're out of time, 
        we're out of time!" We say, like the white rabbit. When we read about the crisis, we go down the 
        rabbit hole. But instead of entering wonderland, we enter a dark reality that we, as humanity, are 
        failing to save our planet.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
        But how do we get back to the light at the beginning of the rabbit hole we have fallen into?

        While direct action is important, internal activism, analysing your own feelings about the climate, 
        is just as important. As you write, I hope you will slowly unravel your emotions about climate 
        change. Just as you don't protest alone, you write with other people who share your feelings. 
        Joining in a collective grief about the future of our earth, because mourning together will make 
        room for hope and a new beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you work on your inner activism and take the first step in dealing with it, you are also taking 
        action. As all the stories together form a banner, share all the stories anonymously as a collective 
        group.
